  <h3>Getting to Know the 2018 Class</h3>
  <p> The "Rare Breed 2018" recruiting class began early in 2017 with the committment of the nation's #2 ranked outside linebacker, Adam Anderson (Rome, GA). Some argued Anderson was the only "big time" player on our commit list, and when he decommitted, some said we would not recruit a good class this year. The nation's #1 ranked kicker, Jake Camarda (Norcross, GA)immediately committed on the same day of the decommittment, and multiple committments from across the country soon followed, such as Owen Condon (Oklahoma City, OK) and Rachad Wildgoose (Miami, FL). At the beginning of Summer 2017, critics were still saying that this recruiting class did not have a big time player. However, that drastically changed after the committment of the top running back in the country, Zamir White (Laurinburg, NC). Since then, we have gained commits such as the country's top player, Justin Fields (Kennesaw, GA), James Cook (Miami, FL), and even got Adam Anderson back. Today, Georgia sits at the top of the SEC and 5th in the nation for 2018 commits. Not bad for a team that had 3 commits at the beginning of June.</p></div>

  <h3>Recruiting</h3>
    <p>The recruiting process for Georgia Football begins with evaluation of film; play history, critical traits, speed, etc. Georgia produces great recruiting classes each year due to the attention to detail put into the recruiting process. When players are invited on campus, they are hosted as honorable guests and get to spend time around the campus and its monstrous facilities. The most valuable aspect of havng recruits on campus is taking them to watch the Dawgs between the hedges in Sanford Stadium. The atmosphere in Athens on gameday is unlike any other, a big factor in why top players in the nation want to play here for their college careers.</p></div>

  <h3>The Smart Effect</h3>
    <p>Kirby Smart has done an impeccable job as Georgia's head coach the past two years. He wins games, and the hearts of recruits and their families. His hire in 2016 actually led to flipping the committment of Jake Fromm from Alabama to Georgia. The Georgia football coaches are what makes the difference in recruiting, especially Kirby Smart. Coach Smart's love for the game as well as his desire to win championships attracts recruits with every visit they make on campus. Other Georgia coaches known for great recruiting include running backs coach Dell McGee, defensive line coah Tray Scott, and offensive line coach Sam Pittman. Justin Fields even recognized Coach McGee as the, "best recruiter in the country," following his committment.
